# Division by Zero Bug in C
This repository demonstrates a common C programming error: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.

The original code attempts to divide an integer by zero, which leads to undefined behavior and typically a program crash. The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.
